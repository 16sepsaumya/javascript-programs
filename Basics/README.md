# ðŸ“˜ JavaScript Basics â€” program.js

Welcome to `program.js`, a beginner-friendly JavaScript file designed to help you learn and practice the fundamentals of JavaScript. This file includes 30+ examples covering essential topics such as variables, data types, operators, loops, functions, arrays, objects, and basic browser interactions.

## ðŸš€ What You'll Learn

This file is structured to introduce you to the building blocks of JavaScript programming:

### 1. Variables

Learn how to declare and use variables with `let`, `const`, and `var`.

### 2. Data Types

Understand primitive types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, and `undefined`.

### 3. Console Output

Use `console.log()` to display messages and debug your code.

### 4. Arithmetic Operators

Perform basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

### 5. Comparison Operators

Compare values using `==`, `===`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.

### 6. Logical Operators

Combine conditions using `&&`, `||`, and `!`.

### 7. Conditional Statements

Use `if`, `else`, and `switch` to control program flow based on conditions.

### 8. Loops

Repeat actions using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

### 9. Functions

Define reusable blocks of code with `function` and arrow functions (`=>`).

### 10. Arrays

Store multiple values in a single variable and manipulate them with methods like `push()`, `pop()`, and `length`.

### 11. Objects

Group related data using key-value pairs and access them with dot or bracket notation.

### 12. Date and Math Objects

Use built-in objects like `Date` and `Math` for time and mathematical operations.

### 13. Strings

Manipulate text using methods like `length`, `toUpperCase()`, and template literals.

### 14. Type Conversion

Convert between strings and numbers using `Number()` and `String()`.

### 15. typeof Operator

Check the type of a variable using `typeof`.

### 16. Ternary Operator

Write concise conditional expressions using `condition ? true : false`.

### 17. Timers

Use `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` to delay or repeat actions.

### 18. Error Handling

Catch and handle errors gracefully using `try-catch`.

### 19. DOM Manipulation

Interact with HTML elements using `document.body.innerHTML`.

### 20. Event Handling

Respond to user actions like clicks using `addEventListener()`.

### 21. Simple Calculator

Build a basic calculator using functions and `switch` statements.
